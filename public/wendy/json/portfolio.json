        "description": "Model United Nations (MUN) is the simulation of the UN's debate and decision-making process. We aim to solve a wide range of real-world problems and global issues, from marine biodiversity in the Red Sea to the Russo-Ukrainian War. In MUN, we participate as a delegate of a country to propose solutions and debate, a chair to provide background information and monitor debate processes, or an organiser to run an entire conference.",
        "achievement": "Since Year 6, I have participated in five conferences as a delegate, four conferences as a chair, and hosted one conference as the Secretary-General. I have won an honourable mention, an Outstanding Delegate, and a Best Delegate award. As the club leader, I have organised three travelling trips outside Beijing and sent delegates to 11 conferences around China in total.",
