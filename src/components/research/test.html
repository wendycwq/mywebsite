    <p><strong>ABSTRACT: </strong>The study presents an analysis of how internet use affects political participation
        in Beijing, supported by a quantitative approach based on survey data. Using 2021 data from the
        Comprehensive Survey of China's Social Conditions with local residents from Beijing, this study applies
        logistic regression to examine how different internet activities relate to various forms of political
        participation, complemented by a descriptive contextual analysis of Beijing's political environment. This
        study has particularly chosen Beijing for its unique political significance and close monitoring of civic
        political interactions as the capital city of China. The results indicate that internet use is positively
        associated with political participation, while other uses, such as social trust social tolerance, show no
        significant effect. Additionally, perceptions of social fairness independently predict political
        participation. Internet use, as an accessible and transparent element of the society, therefore, serves as a
        convenient and efficient tool for the government to boost civic participation in politics. Thus, the study
        recommends that government efforts focus on enhancing credibility and fostering engagement through targeted
        social media outreach and expanded online petition systems. Due to the crosssectional nature of the data and
        reliance on self-reported survey data, causal interpretations should be made cautiously. Future research
        could benefit from longitudinal designs and broader regional comparisons.</p>

    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>Decades into the Information Age, digital technology has advanced from a catalyst of development to a
        fundamental basis of our society. The prevalence of digital technology has grown rapidly, reaching around
        half of the world's population in two decades. Digital technology currently dictates the everyday life of
        most people, from cell phones to surveillance to cybersecurity systems. It is, therefore, crucial to inspect
        the impact of digital technology on society in detail. An interesting case in the world's technological
        development is China. Since the late 20th century, China has seen significant growth and development of its
        digital technology system, as the reform and opening up movement coincided with the invention of the World
        Wide Web in that era. Subsequently, China's digital industry flourished, demonstrating rapid growth in terms
        of revenue and technological knowledge. Data provided by the China Network Information Center (CNNIC) shows
        that, as of June 2025, China has 1.123 billion internet users, approximately 79.7% of the population.
        Against this background, the scale and influence of internet use in China provide a valuable context for
        examining its broader societal impacts.</p>
    <p>An important factor directing society&rsquo;s operation is politics. Nonetheless, not only do governments'
        decisions and policies matter, but also the citizens' participation. Political participation has significant
        effects on democracy and governance. Political participation is the foundation of democracy. The Council of
        Europe has defined democracy as governance based on the will of the people. Political participation
        demonstrates political efficacy, which is an important indicator of whether an individual is motivated to
        participate in various forms of political engagement. It refers to the belief that governments and political
        institutions will respond to public needs (Niemi et al., 1991; Willeck, C., &amp; Mendelberg, T., 2022),
        which empowers people to actively participate. Such confidence leads to democracy, as democracy is the
        manifestation of people's power to impact politics. Secondly, political participation enhances the effect
        and promotes the success of governance. Political participation encourages political responsiveness,
        allowing the impact of policies to be evaluated for feedback and modified by the government for more desired
        effects. Simultaneously, political participation also fosters public trust, reducing societal polarisation
        and political instability.</p>
    <p>Thus, this paper aims to investigate one specific impact that internet use has on citizens in China&mdash;its
        influence on political participation. In the digital era, internet use has become an increasingly relevant
        factor influencing political participation, since the existence of the Internet has broadened the channels
        for people to participate in politics. Just as what Tang, Y., &amp; Wen, Q. (2023) mentioned, social media
        provides timely political information, diverse communication, and interactive features, which enhance
        people's motivation to participate in political discussions and sharing. Similarly, the study by Xu, P., Ye,
        Y., &amp; Zhang, M. (2018) also suggests that physical access to computers and the internet is a crucial
        factor related to political participation.</p>
    <p>Given these considerations, this paper will focus on how internet use affects political participation of
        citizens in Beijing. Beijing has been selected as the region of this study for its unique political value to
        the country as the capital city. Located on the northern end of the North China Plain, Beijing has been a
        historical capital city of multiple ancient Chinese dynasties. Continuing to be the political centre of
        China until today, Beijing's political importance sets it apart from other cities. The general political
        atmosphere is stronger than in other parts of China, enhancing political education provided to Beijing
        students. Moreover, most existing studies on similar topics investigate China as an entire country or large
        regions (such as Western and Eastern China) without further specification down to cities. This could lead to
        neglect of detailed regional traits such as historical background distinct from other parts of the country.
        Therefore, this study will enhance the overall investigation on the topic by focusing on one city, which
        highlights Beijing's distinct background as the capital city.</p>
    <p>The influence of internet usage on civic political participation is significant. With the swift rise of
        social media, users online are increasingly discussing social issues and public events. They also have the
        freedom to engage in conversations regarding political matters and public policy. Furthermore, more
        organisations are using social media to disseminate information about their activities. China is presently
        experiencing a crucial phase of social transformation. Consequently, examining how Chinese citizens engage
        in online political participation through social media holds great importance.</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <h1>LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 Political Participation</h1>
    <p>The definition of politics has changed differently over time. Political participation has been defined by
        Huntington and Nelson (1976) as an activity that affects the government&rsquo;s decision and policy-making
        by actors spontaneously or mobilised by others. "Those actions by private citizens that are more or less
        directly aimed at influencing the selection of governmental personnel and/or the actions they take" is what
        is meant by political participation, according to Verba, S., &amp; Nie, N. H. (1987). There are four
        organised forms of political participation: voting, campaign involvement, cooperative efforts, and contacts
        initiated by citizens. Van Deth, J. W. (2014) summarised four characteristics of political participation,
        including: it contains activities; it is voluntary; it refers to nonprofessional or amateur participants; it
        relates to government, politics or state.</p>
    <p>As technology continues to develop and advance, new avenues for political participation have surfaced in
        digital media, particularly on the Internet. With the evolving forms of participation, both traditional and
        modern methods are encompassed in this categorization, which includes &ldquo;digital network engagement,
        institutionalised participation, protest, voting, civic involvement, and consumer participation&rdquo;
        (Theocharis, Y., &amp; Van Deth, J. W., 2018). These options enable citizens who feel their voices lack
        impact on the political landscape to engage in the political initiatives of their choosing and express their
        identities as they see fit (Marsh, D., &amp; Akram, S., 2015).</p>
    <h1>2.2 Theoretical Perspectives</h1>
    <p>There are many theoretical models of behavioural interpretation of people's political participation. Past
        scholars have investigated the connection between internet use and political participation. Clay Shirky, in
        his book "Here Comes Everybody" (2008), expressed the idea that technology is "a tool for social change."
        This concept underpins the Mobilisation Theory, which posits a positive correlation between social media and
        political participation, as the use of social media reduces the barriers to engaging in political
        activities.</p>
    <p>Indeed, social media provides easier access to political news and discussions, both inspiring and providing a
        platform for political participation. It also lowers the logistical, social, and psychological obstacles
        associated with offline communication to participation. Lastly, it establishes online communities and social
        ties to inspire collective political actions. In essence, this theory argues that social media increases and
        enhances political participation by making it easier in terms of access and cost.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Expanding on this idea, Tang, Y., &amp; Wen, Q. (2023) contend that social media enables anyone to engage in
        political activities, fostering both a form of political participation that is non-institutionalised and one
        that is institutionalised. This has also been observed by Meesuwan, S. (2016) in a study of political
        participation in Thailand, in which it has been concluded that the Internet has made it easier for people to
        contact news media to address governmental issues and engage in collective actions like signing petitions.
    </p>
    <p>However, while the Mobilisation Theory emphasises the facilitative role of social media, some scholars object
        to its overly optimistic stance. For instance, research by Nisbet, M. C., &amp; Scheufele, D. A. (2004) has
        proved that the correlation between Internet use and political participation is very limited, suggesting
        that accessibility does not necessarily translate into active engagement. There are also theoretical
        perspectives that directly challenge the idea of a positive link, proposing instead that the Internet can
        lower political participation. Agger, Robert E., Marshall N. Goldstein, and Stanley A. Pearl (1961)
        discusses political cynicism, which is the idea that when negativity bias is present, meaning that when
        people cynically believe politicians are corrupt and the system is rigged, they see no point in voting,
        protesting, or joining campaigns. This leads to a direct decrease in political participation. The attention
        economy theory suggests that different sources of media compete for the audiences' attention. As T. Wu
        (2017) indicates in their book "The Attention Merchants," such competition hightens the frequency of the
        usage of sensationalist and polarising content on the internet. This exacerbates the problem of political
        cynicism, particularly in the New Media Age in which media prevalence grows rapidly. Thus, it has been
        argued that as the internet maximises political distrust, it leads to a decrease in political efficacy.</p>
    <h1>2.3 Internet Use and Political Participation</h1>
    <p>As noted by Chen, Mo. and Ghulam Rasool Madni. (2024) and Macafee, T., &amp; De Simone, J. J. (2012), the use
        of the internet significantly influences political engagement, particularly through social media, which
        reduces barriers to political involvement by offering individuals a platform to access political content,
        engage in discussions, and participate in campaigns from anywhere with internet access. This accessibility
        fosters broader participation among the population. Individuals can quickly access news, opinions, and
        various viewpoints on political matters. The spread of this information aids people in understanding and
        getting involved, thus enhancing political participation.</p>
    <p>To better understand this relationship, scholars have conducted numerous studies focusing on different
        regions and countries, including Western China, the entire country, and Thailand. Some scholars have also
        studied the situation in China. Tang, Y., &amp; Wen, Q. (2023) has also concluded that the longer university
        students in Western China use social media, the more likely they are to engage in online political
        activities.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Similar patterns have been observed in other contexts. In Thailand, the result is similar. A study by
        Meesuwan, S. (2016) concluded that internet use is significantly and positively associated with political
        participation in Thailand. The study argued that the Internet has made contacting news media to address
        governmental issues and engage in collective actions like signing petitions more accessible and
        convenient.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With regard to China&rsquo;s broader political environment, over time, the Chinese government has been more
        transparent, and people now have access to more information on China, mainly in part to the internet
        (Stockmann, D., &amp; Luo, T., 2025). This aligns with the idea that political participation is a two-way
        process involving active interactions between citizens and government (Wang, Z., &amp; Sun, L., 2017). From
        the latest literature, internet use is related to political participation, so research hypotheses are
        proposed: H1: Internet use has a significant impact on people's political participation. The higher the
        Internet usage, the greater the probability of people's political participation.</p>

    <h1>RESEARCH METHOD 3.1 Data</h1>
    <p>This article utilises data from the Comprehensive Survey of China's Social Conditions (CSS) conducted in
        2021. The data is sourced from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, which launched a large-scale
        nationwide continuous sampling survey project through the Institute of Academic Studies. The CSS2021 project
        employs a multi-stage mixed sampling approach, which involves four sampling stages: counties (cities,
        districts), village (neighbourhood) committees, households, and individual residents, with distinct sampling
        techniques applied at each level. By encompassing a broad range of target groups, the sample achieves a high
        degree of representativeness. After excluding cases with missing values or outliers in relevant variables,
        we were left with a final effective sample of 141 respondents. While this sample size is smaller than those
        in nationwide studies, it still offers adequate statistical power for significant analysis and enhances our
        understanding of the unique aspects of Beijing.</p>
    <h1>3.2 Measures</h1>
    <h2>3.2.1 Dependent Variables</h2>
    <p>The dependent variable identified in this study is political participation, with a specific definition that
        categorises certain activities for easier observation and simplification in determining what qualifies as
        political participation. The 2021 Chinese Social Survey inquired whether respondents engaged in the
        following activities to assess their level of political participation: individuals were classified as having
        participated politically if they had taken part in any of these activities within the last two years:
        discussing political matters with others or on online platforms; reporting social issues to media outlets
        such as newspapers, radio stations, and online forums; submitting opinions to government agencies (including
        through phone calls, emails, etc.); involvement in public policy discussions or public affairs meetings
        using their professional expertise; sharing personal views on government-announced policies through various
        means; attending public policy hearings organized by government bodies; submitting petitions to government
        offices; engaging in discussions regarding significant decisions within one's community or residential unit;
        taking part in community-organised social welfare activities or initiating such efforts, like voluntary
        blood donation, environmental clean-ups, and providing assistance to the elderly, disabled, and patients;
        Engaging in religious practices; participating in collective rights protection actions both online and
        offline. This participation is measured as a binary variable (1 = engaged in political participation, 0 =
        did not engage in political participation), where involvement in any of these activities is recorded as 1,
        and none is noted as 0.</p>
    <h2>3.2.2 Independent Variable</h2>
    <p>The independent variable in this study is the use of the internet. According to the CSS2021 questionnaire,
        this was assessed by the frequency of different online activities, such as searching for political
        information, engaging in entertainment and leisure, chatting and socialising, conducting business or work,
        pursuing learning and education, utilising online shopping and services, and managing investments and
        finances. Utilising the CSS2021 metrics of specific activity usage frequencies, a principal component
        analysis (PCA) was carried out as a method of dimensionality reduction to identify underlying factors. A
        composite index reflecting the frequency of internet usage was subsequently created by reweighting and
        combining the initial variables based on the factor loadings obtained from the PCA findings. The responses
        were coded as: 'Never' and 'Don't use internet' = 0; 'Several times a year' = 1; 'At least once a month' =
        2; 'At least once a week' = 3; 'Multiple times a week' = 4; 'Almost every day' = 5.</p>
    <h2>3.2.3 Control Variables</h2>
    <p>Referring to the current research, factors that generally affect political participation, this study
        incorporates a set of control variables covering both socio-demographic characteristics and personal social
        perception. The socio-demographic controls include: gender (coded as 1 for male and 0 for female); age
        (ranging from 18 to 69 years); education level is treated as an ordinal categorical variable reflecting the
        respondent&rsquo;s highest level of formal education, coded as follows: 1 = no formal schooling, 2 = primary
        school, 3 = junior high school, 4 = senior high school, 5 = technical secondary school, 6 = vocational high
        school or technical school, 7 = junior college (associate degree), 8 = bachelor&rsquo;s degree, and 9 =
        graduate degree (master&rsquo;s or above); marital status (1 for married, 0 for not married), and political
        affiliation (1 for Chinese Communist Party members, 0 for non-members).</p>
    <p>As noted by Shi, Shaocheng, et al. (2022), two aspects of social capital, specifically social trust and
        social tolerance, acted as mediators linking political engagement to the satisfaction of citizens with their
        lives. Therefore, in addition to these demographic variables, the model includes four variables capturing
        respondents&rsquo; subjective social perceptions. These include perceived social fairness (measured on a
        scale from 1 to 10), self-rated socioeconomic status (1&ndash;10 scale), social trust (1&ndash;5 scale), and
        level of social tolerance (1&ndash;10 scale). These variables are designed to reflect individuals&rsquo;
        evaluations of their social environment, which may shape their motivation and capacity for civic engagement.
        By controlling these factors, the analysis aims to isolate the specific effect of internet use on political
        participation while minimising potential bias arising from unobserved heterogeneity in background
        characteristics and subjective attitudes.</p>
    <h1>3.3 Model</h1>
    <p>There are only two types of measurements of people's political participation, and it is suitable to use
        binary logistic regression models. Other models need to consider problems such as normal distribution and
        homovariance, but the logistic regression model can predict the probability of occurrence of different
        categories of a categorical variable, which can well meet the modeling needs of classified data. Therefore,
        this study adopts a binary logistic regression model, whose model is:</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>P is the probability of an event occurring, which is the probability of people's political participation. 1-P
        is the probability of no event occurring, which is no political participation. The larger the P value, the
        greater the possibility of people participating in political behaviour; the smaller the P value, the lower
        the likelihood of political participation behaviour, among which X1, X2,</p>
    <p>X3...Xn, is the independent variable and the control variable.</p>

    <p>Regarding internet use and its sub-dimensions, business- and work-related online activities show the highest
        average frequency (Mean = 2.342), indicating that respondents are relatively active in using the internet
        for occupational or commercial purposes, such as running online stores or livestreaming for sales. In
        contrast, investment and financial management activities have the lowest average frequency (Mean = 1.437)
        and the smallest standard deviation (SD = 0.738), suggesting both a generally low level of participation and
        relatively little variation across individuals in this area. The composite factor of internet use, derived
        through dimensionality reduction, has a mean of 5.527 and a large standard deviation of 12.368, indicating a
        moderate average level of internet engagement overall, but with substantial individual
        differences&mdash;some respondents use the internet very frequently, while others engage only rarely.</p>
    <p>As for political participation, the mean value is 0.482, which is close to 0.5, suggesting that the sample is
        nearly evenly split between those who reported political participation and those who did not. This reflects
        a moderate level of political engagement among respondents.</p>
    <p>For the control variables, the mean value for gender is 0.494, indicating an approximately balanced gender
        distribution in the sample. The mean value for age is 14.603; however, considering that the recorded minimum
        and maximum ages are 19 and 69 respectively, this figure may reflect a data entry issue. In practice, the
        age range is concentrated between 19 and 69 years. The mean value for education level is 2.241. Based on the
        coding scheme (1 = no formal schooling, 9 = graduate degree), this implies that most respondents have
        relatively low levels of education, typically around primary or junior high school. The mean value for
        marital status is 0.438, suggesting that slightly fewer than half of the respondents are currently married.
        Political affiliation has a mean of 0.425, indicating that about 42.5% of the sample are party
        members&mdash;higher than the national average, possibly due to the political context of Beijing.</p>
    <p>For personal social perception variables, the mean values are relatively low: social trust (Mean = 2.013),
        social tolerance (Mean = 1.759), and perceived social fairness (Mean = 1.835), each with substantial
        standard deviations. This indicates considerable variation in respondents&rsquo; perceptions of social
        relationships and institutional fairness. Lastly, self-evaluated socioeconomic status has a mean value of
        0.927, suggesting that respondents tend to rate their socioeconomic position at a relatively low level.</p>

    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>In this dataset, we observe that different factors exhibit positive, negative, or minimal correlations with
        political participation. Variables with a positive regression coefficient&mdash;such as internet use (B =
        0.133, p = 0.001), education level (B = 0.296, p = 0.010), marital status (B = 0.338), political affiliation
        (B = 1.162, p = 0.049), socioeconomic status (B = 0.353), and social tolerance (B = 0.222) &mdash; suggest a
        positive association with political participation. In particular, individuals who are married, more
        educated, or affiliated with the Communist Party are more likely to participate politically.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, variables such as gender (B = -1.057, p = 0.031), social trust (B = -0.263), and perceived
        social fairness (B = 0.424, p = 0.007) show negative associations. Specifically, females have lower odds of
        political participation compared to males, and higher perceived social fairness is associated with less
        political engagement. This may reflect that individuals who perceive society as fair are less likely to feel
        the need to participate politically, a pattern consistent with grievance-based theories of political
        behaviour. Meanwhile, age has a coefficient of 0.005, which is too small to be considered meaningful,
        indicating that age has virtually no correlation with political participation.</p>
    <p>More importantly, statistical significance further clarifies which variables have a meaningful impact. A
        p-value below 0.05 indicates a statistically significant relationship. In this analysis, internet use is
        significantly and positively correlated with political participation (p = 0.001), with an odds ratio of
        1.143, meaning that each one-unit increase in internet use increases the odds of political participation by
        14.3%, controlling for other factors. Similarly, education level (Exp(B) = 1.345) and political affiliation
        (Exp(B) = 3.197) also show strong positive and significant effects. In contrast, perceived social fairness
        has a significant negative effect (Exp(B) = 0.655), further supporting the idea that individuals satisfied
        with the current level of fairness in society may have less motivation to take political action.</p>
    <p>Variables such as age, marital status, socioeconomic status, social trust, and social tolerance did not reach
        statistical significance</p>
    <p>in this model, suggesting their influence on political participation is limited or context-dependent within
        this dataset.</p>

    <p>The Probit model results are consistent with our main logistic regression findings, confirming the robustness
        of our analysis. Internet use maintains significance in positively impacting political participation
        (estimate=0.078, p=0.001). Similarly, gender, education level, political affiliation, and social fairness
        perception remain significant predictors with directions consistent with the main model. The consistency
        across model specifications strengthens our confidence in the strong connection between internet use and
        political participation among Beijing residents.</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <h1>DISCUSSION 5.1 Discussion of Key Findings</h1>
    <p>The results indicate that internet use has a significant positive correlation with political participation,
        hypothesis H1 H2 have been verified. This result is the same with other studies by Bakker, Tom P., and Claes
        H. De Vreese (2011). They study on how internet use affects political participation of young people, argued
        that interactive digital dialogue is positively related to political participation, and that internet use is
        a strong predictor for both traditional and newer forms of political participation. Chang, Alex Chuan-hsien
        (2018) also observed a similar trend in Taiwan, supported by the evidence that internet use significantly
        enhanced young citizen's political participation. A more recent study from 2023 also suggests that certain
        types of online network group are significantly correlated with higher political participation intention,
        including neighourhood and alumni.</p>
    <p>As for our control variables, gender is another variable that has significant impact on political
        participation. Wang, Song-In (2007) observed in their results that male users are more likely to use the
        internet politically compared to female users. Overall, while females vote at similar rates to males in many
        democratic states, males tend to be more active than females in more direct and intense political
        activities, such as making campaign donations and joining politics-related organisations (Burns et al.
        2001).</p>
    <p>Education level, as a control variable, has also shown significant correlation with political participation.
        Traditionally, education has always been recognised as a catalyst for political change by many modernisation
        theorists (Y. Wang 2016). A similar conclusion has been made by Wang, Song-In. In their study on political
        use of the internet, Wang conveyed the idea that those with higher education are more likely to use the
        internet for political purposes, indicating that they are more active in politics in general.</p>
    <p>In China's relatively special political context, political affiliation directly impacts political
        participation, since political participation provides CPC members with more effective career development
        opportunities.</p>
    <p>One's opinion on social fairness and satisfaction have been found to be another factor significantly
        correlated with political participation. The study of the impact of political participation on the life
        satisfaction of Chinese urban residents by Shi, Shaocheng, et al. (2022) proved that, at the 5% significance
        level, the life satisfaction of urban residents with political participation was 0.145 units higher than
        that of urban residents without political participation. This is because social fairness and satisfaction
        are largely based on governmental policies to set the society's fundamental tone. The government's policies
        should directly address age, gender, ethnicity/race, etc. Although some cultural inequalities are hard to
        prohibit directly through political actions, advocacy with the government as a strong role model is crucial.
    </p>
    <p>Social trust, however, does not significantly impact political participation. Social trust is largely focused
        on interpersonal level communication and interactions. This means that social trust is rooted in personal
        experiences and emotions. Political efficacy, on the other hand, is based on one's perception of the
        government, related to their interactions with the government and its policies instead of fellow citizens.
        In China, where direct political participation is less encouraged and observed than other countries in the
        world, the distance between private interpersonal issues and politics is increased. This leads to citizens
        separating personal emotions with governmental policies, leading to a discrepancy between one's perception
        of social trust and political efficacy. Therefore, as social trust is confined to personal networks, it does
        not affect political participation significantly due to the distance of social relations to the government's
        policies.</p>
    <p>Social tolerance shares a similar situation with social trust. Nonetheless, the complexity of the definition
        of social tolerance in the CSS questionnaire contributes to the insignificant correlation additionally. In
        the questionnaire, the recipients are asked to give a score from 1 to 4 of whether can they accept six
        groups of people: people who live together before marriage, homosexuals, beggars, those who are released
        from prison, those who have different religious beliefs, and patients with AIDS. This is a mixed population
        as the citizens' perception of these groups can be significantly impacted by multiple aspects, including
        culture, tradition, personal safety, etc. Moreover, not all of these groups are directly linked to politics.
        For instance, released person after prison is related to legislation directly, while cohabiting before
        marriage has no correlation with governmental policies. Thus, as social tolerance is complicated in terms of
        the minority groups and their relevance to politics, a collective conclusion on its correlation to political
        participation cannot be made, indicating insignificant impact on political participation.</p>
    <h1>5.2 Suggestion&nbsp;</h1>
    <p>Based on the conclusion that internet use affects political participation significantly, we can infer that
        the Chinese government can both enhance their presence and emphasise democracy in the society by utilising
        the internet, which appeals to the socialist core values as it includes democracy.</p>
    <p>Firstly, the internet serves as a convenient and far-reaching platform for the government to enhance its
        visibility and credibility. With 79.7% of China&rsquo;s population having internet access, digital channels
        provide an efficient way to disseminate information and shape public opinion. By adopting modern social
        media strategies, the government can increase public awareness of its initiatives and foster trust.
        Platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and Douyin are widely used, making them ideal for sharing information about
        volunteer opportunities and community activities to promote participation in such activities. For instance,
        state agencies could create engaging short videos or interactive articles to explain policies in a more
        relatable manner. Such content could simplify complex political messages, making them more digestible for
        the general public. This is crucial as political participation is based on political knowledge reception.
    </p>
    <p>Secondly, the internet can facilitate more convenient and direct political participation, bridging the gap
        between citizens and policymakers, since the internet expands people's access to communication with the
        government, other citizens, and other social groups like newspapers. Traditional offline methods, such as
        community meetings, often have logistical and physical constraints, limiting public involvement. However,
        digital tools can overcome these barriers by allowing real-time feedback and engagement. For example, the
        government could expand online petition systems, enabling citizens to voice concerns or suggestions more
        directly.</p>
    <p>Online petitions could be streamlined through mobile apps, ensuring that public grievances are efficiently
        recorded and addressed, allowing general expression regarding politics to be more efficient. However, as
        what Chen, M., &amp; Madni, G. R. (2024) emphasised, it must be recognised that China's political
        participation is carried out in a tightly regulated and organised system in which dissent or activities that
        violate national interests are strictly restricted, so people's actual political participation may be
        limited by this approach. Therefore, more active responses to feedback and a larger scope of political
        discussion can be included in these online systems, as making people feel that their opinions are respected
        will encourage them to continue with such a form of political participation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
    <p>This study contributes to existing literature by focusing on the political participation of urban residents
        in Beijing, providing a localised examination of the relationship between internet use and political
        engagement. Unlike many previous studies that rely on national-level or youth-focused samples, this research
        fills a gap by analysing a representative sample of Beijing&rsquo;s adult population, thus offering insights
        specific to a major metropolitan context within China&rsquo;s unique political environment.</p>
    <p>Using quantitative methods and data from a recent survey, the study finds that internet use is profoundly and
        positively correlated to political participation among Beijing residents. Specifically, a one-unit increase
        in internet use corresponds to a 14.3% increase in the odds of political participation, after controlling
        other sociodemographic factors. Furthermore, political affiliation (i.e., Communist Party membership) and
        education level also show strong positive effects, whereas perceived social fairness is negatively
        associated with political participation.</p>
    <p>These findings highlight several key points. First, the study confirms prior international research that
        interactive internet use fosters political engagement, extending this insight to an urban Chinese context.
        Second, it identifies gender and political affiliation as important determinants of political activity, with
        males and party members being more politically active. Third, the negative correlation between perceived
        social fairness and participation suggests that political engagement may be driven by grievances or
        dissatisfaction, aligning with grievance-based political behavior theories. Finally, the study examines the
        roles of social trust and social tolerance, which do not show significant impact on political participation
        in this sample, possibly reflecting the distinct separation between interpersonal trust and political
        efficacy in Beijing&rsquo;s sociopolitical landscape.</p>
    <p>By focusing on Beijing residents and incorporating a robust logistic regression and binary logistic
        regression analysis, this research adds empirical evidence to debates on internet-mediated political
        participation in authoritarian contexts, enriching understanding of how digital engagement interacts with
        sociopolitical factors at the urban level.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, this study has several limitations that to be acknowledged. Firstly, internet use was measured
        through self-reported data, which may introduce bias due to recall inaccuracies or social desirability
        effects. Participants might overestimate or misrepresent their online activities, affecting the reliability
        of the findings. Second, the key variables are binary as one either participates in politics or don't, which
        could fail to capture the continuous scale or frequency of participation. A more nuanced measurement, such
        as scales or continuous variables, could provide deeper insights into how different levels of internet
        engagement influence political behaviour. Third, the study focused exclusively on people in Beijing. There
        is heterogeneity in the study results of rural population and urban population of Beijing. According to the
        China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), there is still a large gap between urban and rural areas,
        and this gap has not changed much for a long time despite the increasing use of the Internet. Thus, they may
        have different internet usage patterns and political engagement behaviours due to varying access, digital
        literacy, and socio-cultural contexts. Future research should include more diverse demographics to enhance
        external validity. Additionally, the study did not fully account for broader cultural and institutional
        factors shaping political participation in China. The interplay between internet use and political
        engagement is likely mediated by other factors, such as political efficacy, censorship, propaganda, and
        social norms, which all have impact on political participation (Tang, Y., &amp; Wen, Q., 2023). These
        factors require further qualitative or mixed-methods exploration. Finally, the research was geographically
        restricted to Beijing, a politically and economically unique region. Findings may not apply to other Chinese
        cities or provinces with different governance structures and internet penetration rates. Future studies
        should expand the scope to ensure broader applicability. Addressing these limitations would strengthen the
        understanding of internet use&rsquo;s role in political participation in China.</p>
